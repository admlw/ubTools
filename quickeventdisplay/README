Designed for use with analysistree. To view an event pass the root file containing the analysistree and the C file (quickeventdisplay.C or quickeventdisplay3d.C) and the rest should be taken care of.

The default variables are
track: pandoraCosmicKHit
vertex: pandoraCosmic
but these can be changed by a simple find and replace.
